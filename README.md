# Customer Support Automation of Ticket Creation (RPA) using UiPath

In today's fast-paced digital environment, efficient management of customer support requests is critical for maintaining service quality and customer satisfaction. Manual ticket creation from customer emails is often time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks scalability, especially during high-volume periods. This project presents an automated ticketing system using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) powered by UiPath to streamline the process of extracting critical data from customer complaint emails and generating support tickets in a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.

The solution automates key steps, including email monitoring, data extraction, validation, and ticket creation. It identifies critical fields such as customer IDs, issue descriptions, and priority levels, while also handling incomplete data scenarios through automated follow-up emails. To maintain communication continuity, the system links follow-up responses with original tickets using unique thread identifiers. Additionally, it addresses frequent queries by sending predefined responses for structured requests, ensuring faster resolutions and reducing workload on support staff.

To ensure scalability, the project leverages multiple RPA bots operating in parallel, capable of handling high volumes of customer interactions simultaneously. The outcome is a scalable, accurate, and resource-efficient automation system that enhances customer satisfaction, reduces operational costs, and minimizes manual intervention, making it a valuable asset for businesses across various industries.
